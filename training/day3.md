## File paths
1. File paths describe the location of a file. There are two types of file paths:
  * Absolute file path: e.g. ```https://www.w3schools.com/images/picture.jpg```
    * Full URL to an internet file
  * Relative file path: e.g. ```images/picture.jpg```
    * File location relative to the current page
2. We will primarily be using relative file paths, especially when linking our CSS and JS files. Below are a few examples.
